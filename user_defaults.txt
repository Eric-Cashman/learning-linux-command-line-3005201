USER DEFAULTS - /etc/skel Directory
===================================

The /etc/skel directory is used to populate new user home directories
with default files and configuration.

CREATING DEFAULT FILES FOR NEW USERS:

1. Navigate to /etc/skel:
   cd /etc/skel

2. Create a default file (example: quotes.txt):
   sudo touch quotes.txt

3. Any new user created after this will automatically get:
   - A copy of quotes.txt in their home directory

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:

1. Create default quotes file:
   sudo touch /etc/skel/quotes.txt

2. Create new user (kirk):
   sudo useradd -m -d /tmp/kirk_home -G sudo,adm,trek -s /bin/bash kirk

3. Check kirk's home directory:
   ls -la /tmp/kirk_home/
   
4. Notice that quotes.txt is now in kirk's directory!

THIS IS USEFUL FOR:
- Pre-populating configuration files
- Setting default templates
- Ensuring all new users have consistent baseline files
- Providing example files for users to modify

NOTE: Files in /etc/skel are only copied when the user is created.
Changes to /etc/skel won't affect existing users.
